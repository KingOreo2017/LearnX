                        Once upon a time, there was a girl named Druzella. She was captured by the evil
                    snow king, Frost, to stop her from marrying her prince, Henry. Prince Henry was
                    on a journey to save her but was stopped by many obstacles on his path. 
            </p></center>

                        This is normal 1 by 1 addition. Using the given number line,

                1. Prince Henry was heading into the swap when he was stopped by two ogers. The first oger
                   demanded he pay 3 gold to pass. The Second demanded he pay 6 gold. How much gold does Prince
                   Henry have to pay?
            </p>
                <div class="slidecontainer">
                     <input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" class="slider" id="myRange">
                 </div>
            <p>
                2. Prince Henry arrived at the gates of the Ice Palace. He had to climb over the 
                   nearby fence to enter. He used a 2 foot stand to be the same height as the fense. 
                   to climb over. Prince Henry is 6 feet tall. How tall is the fense?
